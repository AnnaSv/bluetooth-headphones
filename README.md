# bluetooth-headphones
Dumb code to make Bluetooth headphones work with Ubuntu Linux.

This script disconnects the specified bluetooth headset and reconnects it as an audio sink (so your music sounds like music, not like hold music). Edit headphones.sh to use the name of your bluetooth headphones, then run with ./headphones.sh. Bluetooth must be enabled and on before running the script, or it will throw an error.
